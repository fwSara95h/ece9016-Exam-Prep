    - **Answer: B) Automated compliance policies**
    - **Explanation:** Automating compliance and security policies within DevOps practices is crucial for maintaining security throughout the software development lifecycle.

---

11. What DevOps practice involves managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes?
   - **Answer: C) Infrastructure as Code**
   - **Explanation:** Infrastructure as Code allows developers and operations teams to automatically manage and provision the technology stack for applications through software, rather than using a manual process.

---

12. Which component in the CI/CD pipeline is primarily responsible for compiling the committed code into a runnable build?
   - **Answer: B) The CI tool**
   - **Explanation:** The Continuous Integration (CI) tool is responsible for compiling the committed code into a runnable build, ensuring that the software is consistently ready for deployment.

---

13. What is the primary advantage of using Canary deployments according to the document?
   - **Answer: B) They minimize the risk by targeting a small user base initially.**
   - **Explanation:** Canary deployments target a small group of users or servers initially, which helps in minimizing the risks associated with the deployment by allowing for early detection of potential issues.

---

14. What is the main focus of Continuous Monitoring in DevOps practices?
   - **Answer: B) To understand the impact on end-user experience**
   - **Explanation:** Continuous Monitoring focuses on tracking and analyzing the system's operations to understand their impact on the end-user experience and to quickly address any issues that arise.

---

15. Which deployment strategy switches traffic between two identical environments to minimize downtime?
   - **Answer: D) Blue/Green Deployment**
   - **Explanation:** Blue/Green Deployment involves two identical production environments, only one of which is live at any time. Traffic is switched between these environments to minimize downtime during updates.

---

16. How does Continuous Delivery differ from Continuous Deployment in terms of production deployment?
   - **Answer: C) Continuous Delivery may require manual approval for production deployment.**
   - **Explanation:** While Continuous Deployment automatically deploys all changes to production, Continuous Delivery prepares all changes for release but may require manual approval before actual deployment.

---

17. What is the benefit of adopting Microservices as stated in the document?
   - **Answer: D) Enables independent deployment of services**
   - **Explanation:** Microservices architecture allows individual services to be deployed independently of each other, which can increase agility and scalability in the development process.

---

18. In the context of DevOps, what does the term 'Rolling Deployment' refer to?
   - **Answer: B) Gradually replacing old versions with new ones in phases**
   - **Explanation:** Rolling deployments update software versions incrementally across the deployment infrastructure, which helps in minimizing the impact on the system's availability and user experience.

---

19. What does the term 'Infrastructure as Code' imply about DevOps practices?
   - **Answer: B) Infrastructure setup and changes are scripted and automated.**
   - **Explanation:** Infrastructure as Code means that all setup and maintenance of infrastructure are performed through code which is automated, versioned, and repeatable, reducing manual errors and inconsistencies.

---

20. Which aspect of DevOps emphasizes the enhancement of interaction and shared responsibilities?
    - **Answer: D) Communication and Collaboration**
    - **Explanation:** Communication and collaboration are key aspects of DevOps that help to enhance interaction and shared responsibilities between development and operations teams, fostering a more efficient and integrated workflow.

---

21. What DevOps practice emphasizes automation in the build and test phases before production deployment?
   - **Answer: C) Continuous Integration**
   - **Explanation:** Continuous Integration emphasizes automating the build and test phases, ensuring that changes are consistently tested and ready for release before they reach production.

---

22. What type of deployment uses two identical environments to facilitate a zero-downtime transition and easy rollback?
   - **Answer: C) Blue/Green Deployment**
   - **Explanation:** Blue/Green Deployment utilizes two identical environments to ensure zero downtime during transitions and easy rollback in case of issues, by switching traffic between these environments.

---
